Topic - Deploy a static HTML website using CI/CD pipeline.

I have tried to implement this using AWS CodeStar, a tool which configures AWS CodeBuild, CodeCommit and CodeDeploy and CodePipeline.

After using the standard static HTML website template, I tried to edit and update it to see if the changes in source ccode repository triggers a new deploy.

I have used CoeCommit repository, screenshots attached.
