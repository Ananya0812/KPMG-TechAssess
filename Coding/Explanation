Hello,

I tried to create a short Python program to send an email using python.
Added sender and receiver email address in the code which also asks for password, and sends a message if sent successfully using Python.
I used "server" variable to connect it to Gmail using smtplib.
My idea was to run this session but smtplib wasn't installed on my computer and started facing issues with installing pip.

Regards,
Ananya Shah
