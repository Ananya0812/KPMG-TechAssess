Hello,

I have tried to give a demo on how to make an EC2 instance and a security group using Cloudformation.
JSON template has been used as a script.
Attached files include a visual diagram, JSON file template and screenshots of it's implementation in my AWS account.
Based on the script, I have successfully managed to create EC2 instance and a security group

Kind regards,
Ananya Shah
