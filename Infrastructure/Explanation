I have tried to give a demo on how to make an EC2 instance and a security group using Cloudformation.

JSON template has been used as a script.

Attached files include a visual diagram, JSON file template and a screenshot of it's implementation in my AWS account.

Based on the script, I have successfully managed to create a security group but I was facing some issues with creating the instance.
